## Key Enhancements Made

### 1. **LLM-Powered Keyword Extraction**
- **Before**: Basic string splitting with hardcoded stop words
- **After**: Azure OpenAI-powered semantic keyword extraction
- **Improvement**: Now extracts contextually relevant terms and understands query intent

```python
# Enhanced keyword extraction using LLM
async def _extract_search_keywords(self, query: str) -> List[str]:
    # Uses Azure OpenAI to extract semantic keywords and intent
    # Fallback to basic extraction only if LLM fails
```

### 2. **Semantic Entity Search**
- **Before**: Basic string matching (`contains()` logic)
- **After**: Embedding-based semantic similarity search with cosine similarity
- **Improvement**: Finds conceptually related entities, not just exact string matches

```python
# Enhanced search with semantic similarity
async def search_entities(self, query: str, limit: int = 10):
    # Generates query embeddings
    # Calculates cosine similarity with stored entity embeddings
    # Ranks results by semantic relevance
```

### 3. **Natural Language Query Interpretation**
- **Before**: No query understanding, direct keyword extraction
- **After**: LLM interprets user intent and suggests optimal search strategies
- **Improvement**: Understands complex queries and routes them appropriately

```python
# New natural language interpretation
async def _interpret_natural_language_query(self, query: str):
    # Determines search intent (entities, relationships, communities, etc.)
    # Suggests search strategy (exact_match, semantic_search, broad_exploration)
    # Provides confidence levels and explanations
```

### 4. **LLM-Enhanced Result Processing**
- **Before**: Raw results displayed without context
- **After**: LLM analyzes and enhances results with insights and suggestions
- **Improvement**: Provides intelligent insights, follow-up suggestions, and identifies gaps

```python
# Enhanced result processing
async def _enhance_search_results_with_llm(self, query: str, results: List[Dict], interpretation: Dict):
    # Reorders results by relevance
    # Provides insights about patterns and findings
    # Suggests follow-up queries
    # Identifies missing information or gaps
```

## Validation Tests Conducted

### ‚úÖ Test 1: LLM Keyword Extraction (4/4 passed)
- **Tested**: Complex natural language queries
- **Verified**: Contextual keyword extraction using Azure OpenAI
- **Examples**: 
  - "Find all people who work for technology companies" ‚Üí ['Person', 'works_for', 'Technology Company', 'employment relationship', 'company type']
  - "Show me sustainable products and their manufacturers" ‚Üí ['sustainable product', 'manufacturer', 'produced_by', 'sustainability', 'product-manufacturer network']

### ‚úÖ Test 2: Semantic Entity Search (4/4 passed)
- **Tested**: Various search terms with semantic similarity
- **Verified**: Embedding-based search returns conceptually relevant results
- **Examples**:
  - "technology company" ‚Üí Found Microsoft, Tesla
  - "sustainable product" ‚Üí Found relevant sustainability-related entities
  - "renewable energy" ‚Üí Found sustainability concepts and technologies

### ‚úÖ Test 3: Natural Language Interpretation (4/4 passed)
- **Tested**: Complex natural language queries
- **Verified**: LLM correctly interprets intent and suggests strategies
- **Examples**:
  - "Show me all people who work for organizations in the tech industry" ‚Üí Intent: search_entities, Strategy: semantic_search, Confidence: 0.95
  - "Analyze the network of suppliers and manufacturers" ‚Üí Intent: analyze_subgraphs, Strategy: broad_exploration, Confidence: 0.92

### ‚úÖ Test 4: Dynamic Query Generation (4/4 passed)
- **Tested**: Different search patterns without hardcoded queries
- **Verified**: System generates appropriate queries dynamically
- **Examples**: Exact match, partial match, semantic search, and broad exploration all work correctly

### ‚úÖ Test 5: LLM Result Enhancement (1/1 passed)
- **Tested**: Result enhancement with insights and suggestions
- **Verified**: LLM provides meaningful insights and follow-up suggestions
- **Example**: "Find technology companies and their products" ‚Üí Enhanced with insights about major technology companies and suggested related queries
