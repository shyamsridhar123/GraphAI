## Business Logic Implementation

### 1. Episodic Data Ingestion Architecture

**Event Processing Pipeline:**
```python
async def process_business_event(event_data):
    """
    Transform raw business events into knowledge graph episodes
    """
    # 1. Event Classification
    event_type = classify_event(event_data)
    
    # 2. Context Enrichment
    enriched_context = await enrich_with_historical_data(event_data)
    
    # 3. Natural Language Generation
    narrative = generate_business_narrative(enriched_context)
    
    # 4. Entity & Relationship Extraction
    entities = await extract_entities_with_ai(narrative)
    relationships = await extract_relationships_with_ai(narrative, entities)
    
    # 5. Knowledge Graph Integration
    episode_id = await graphiti.add_episode(Episode(
        content=narrative,
        episode_id=generate_unique_id(event_data),
        metadata=enriched_context
    ))
    
    return episode_id
```

**Example Event Transformation:**
```
Raw Event: {"customer_id": "CUST_001", "product_id": "SHOE_123", "action": "purchase", "amount": 120.00}

Generated Narrative: "Sarah Johnson completed purchase of Men's SuperLight Wool Runners for $120.00. 
The transaction was successful and the customer received a confirmation email. Sarah has shown 
consistent interest in sustainable footwear and this purchase aligns with her previous browsing 
behavior in the eco-friendly product category."

Extracted Entities:
- PERSON: Sarah Johnson (customer, eco-conscious segment)
- PRODUCT: Men's SuperLight Wool Runners (sustainable footwear)
- EVENT: Purchase transaction ($120.00, online channel)

Extracted Relationships:
- purchased(Sarah Johnson, Men's SuperLight Wool Runners, confidence=1.0)
- belongs_to(Men's SuperLight Wool Runners, sustainable_footwear_category)
- aligns_with(purchase, previous_browsing_behavior)
```

### 2. Intelligent Recommendation Engine

**Multi-Dimensional Recommendation Logic:**
```python
async def generate_personalized_recommendations(customer_id, context=None):
    """
    Generate recommendations using knowledge graph intelligence
    """
    # 1. Customer Profile Analysis
    customer_profile = await analyze_customer_graph_position(customer_id)
    
    # 2. Behavioral Pattern Mining
    behavior_patterns = await mine_interaction_patterns(customer_id)
    
    # 3. Similar Customer Discovery
    similar_customers = await find_similar_customers(customer_profile, behavior_patterns)
    
    # 4. Product Affinity Calculation
    product_affinities = await calculate_product_affinities(
        customer_profile, similar_customers, context
    )
    
    # 5. Temporal Context Integration
    seasonal_adjustments = await apply_temporal_context(product_affinities)
    
    # 6. Business Rule Application
    final_recommendations = await apply_business_rules(
        seasonal_adjustments, inventory_status, margin_priorities
    )
    
    return final_recommendations
```

### 3. Supply Chain Intelligence Framework

**Disruption Prediction & Response:**
```python
async def assess_supply_chain_risk():
    """
    Continuous supply chain risk assessment using graph analysis
    """
    # 1. Network Vulnerability Analysis
    critical_paths = await identify_critical_supply_paths()
    single_points_of_failure = await find_supply_bottlenecks()
    
    # 2. Supplier Performance Monitoring
    supplier_scores = await calculate_supplier_reliability_scores()
    quality_trends = await analyze_quality_trend_patterns()
    
    # 3. External Risk Integration
    market_risks = await integrate_external_risk_data()
    geopolitical_factors = await assess_geopolitical_impacts()
    
    # 4. Predictive Risk Modeling
    risk_scenarios = await model_disruption_scenarios()
    impact_assessments = await calculate_business_impact(risk_scenarios)
    
    # 5. Mitigation Strategy Generation
    response_plans = await generate_response_strategies(impact_assessments)
    
    return {
        'risk_level': calculate_overall_risk_score(),
        'critical_suppliers': identify_at_risk_suppliers(),
        'mitigation_strategies': response_plans,
        'monitoring_alerts': setup_real_time_monitoring()

## Episode Architecture & Implementation

### Episode-Driven Knowledge Construction

**What are Episodes?**
Episodes are the fundamental building blocks of the Graphiti-Cosmos knowledge graph. Each episode represents a discrete business event transformed into a rich narrative that captures context, entities, and relationships. Unlike traditional event logs that store raw data, episodes preserve business meaning and temporal context.

**Episode Structure:**
```python
@dataclass
class Episode:
    content: str           # Rich narrative describing the business event
    episode_id: str       # Unique identifier for temporal ordering
    source: str           # Origin system or process (default: "user_input")
    timestamp: datetime   # Precise temporal context
    metadata: Dict        # Additional contextual information
```

### Episode Processing Pipeline

**1. Event Ingestion & Classification**
```python
async def classify_episode_type(raw_event):
    """AI-powered classification of business events"""
    event_types = {
        "transaction": ["purchase", "payment", "order", "checkout"],

```

**2. Narrative Generation**
```python
async def generate_episode_narrative(raw_event, context):
    """Transform raw event data into rich business narrative"""
    prompt = f"""
    Transform this business event into a comprehensive narrative that captures:

    - How it connects (relationships to other events/entities)
    
    Raw Event: {raw_event}
    Business Context: {context}
    
    Generate a narrative that preserves business meaning and enables relationship extraction.
    """
    
    narrative = await openai_client.generate_completion(prompt)
    return narrative
```

**3. Entity & Relationship Extraction**
```python
async def extract_episode_intelligence(episode_content):
    """Extract entities and relationships from episode content"""
    
    # Entity extraction with type classification
    entities = await extract_entities_with_types(episode_content)

    query = """
    g.V().hasLabel('episode')
     .has('timestamp', between(startDate, endDate))
     .order().by('timestamp', asc)
    """
    
    if event_type:
        query += f".has('event_type', '{event_type}')"
    
    return await execute_gremlin_query(query, {
        'startDate': start_date.isoformat(),
        'endDate': end_date.isoformat()
    })
```

### Technical Discoveries

**1. Azure Cosmos DB Gremlin API Adaptations**
```python
# Critical Technical Insight: Cosmos DB Gremlin Limitations
# The .times() traversal step is not supported, requiring custom implementations

# BEFORE (Standard Gremlin - Not Supported in Cosmos DB):
query = "g.V(entityId).repeat(both().simplePath()).times(maxHops)"

# AFTER (Cosmos DB Compatible):
query = """
g.V(entityId).as('center')
  .both().as('hop1')
  .both().as('hop2')
  .path()
  .by(valueMap(true))
"""
```

**2. Entity ID Sanitization Requirements**
```python
# Critical Discovery: Invalid Characters in Entity IDs
# Cosmos DB Graph requires specific ID formatting

def sanitize_entity_id(raw_id):
    """Essential for Cosmos DB Graph compatibility"""
    return str(raw_id).replace("/", "_").replace("\\", "_").replace(" ", "_")
```

**3. Async Client Management**
```python
# Resolution for Event Loop Conflicts
async def safe_client_cleanup():
    """Prevents async cleanup warnings in Windows environments"""
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    await loop.run_in_executor(None, lambda: client.close())
```
