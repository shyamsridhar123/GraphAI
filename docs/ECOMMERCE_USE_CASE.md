## 🎭 Episode Architecture & Implementation

### What Are Episodes in E-commerce Context?

Episodes are the fundamental building blocks of the e-commerce knowledge graph - discrete business events that capture meaningful interactions between customers, products, and the marketplace. Each episode represents a coherent unit of business activity with temporal context, entity relationships, and actionable intelligence.

### Episode Types in E-commerce

#### 1. **Transaction Episodes**
```
Episode: "Customer Purchase Event"
- Entities: [Customer], [Product(s)], [Payment Method], [Shipping Address]
- Relationships: purchased, paid_with, shipped_to
- Context: Order value, discount applied, fulfillment time
- Intelligence: Purchase patterns, product affinity, customer value signals

Example: "Sarah Johnson purchased iPhone 15 Pro and protective case using credit card for delivery to home address"
```

#### 2. **Customer Journey Episodes**
```
Episode: "Product Discovery & Consideration"
- Entities: [Customer], [Product], [Category], [Search Terms], [Session]
- Relationships: browsed, searched, viewed, compared, abandoned
- Context: Time spent, pages visited, referral source
- Intelligence: Intent signals, interest patterns, conversion probability

Example: "Alex Chen searched for 'wireless headphones', browsed Electronics category, compared 3 products, and added AirPods Pro to wishlist"
```

#### 3. **Product Lifecycle Episodes**
```
Episode: "Product Performance & Market Response"
- Entities: [Product], [Category], [Inventory], [Reviews], [Competitors]
- Relationships: reviewed_by, competes_with, substitutes_for, complements
- Context: Stock levels, review sentiment, pricing changes
- Intelligence: Product success metrics, market positioning, optimization opportunities

Example: "Samsung Galaxy Watch received 4.5-star review from tech enthusiast customer, inventory decreased to 15 units, competitor Apple Watch price increased by 10%"
```

#### 4. **Market Intelligence Episodes**
```
Episode: "Market Trend & Seasonal Pattern"
- Entities: [Category], [Time Period], [Customer Segment], [Geographic Region]
- Relationships: trending_in, popular_among, seasonal_peak, regional_preference
- Context: Sales volume, customer demographics, external factors
- Intelligence: Demand forecasting, inventory planning, marketing optimization

Example: "Winter clothing category showing 200% increase in searches from customers aged 25-45 in northern regions, with early-season buyers preferring premium brands"
```

### Episode Processing Pipeline

#### 1. **Event Capture & Classification**
```python
# Real-time event ingestion from multiple sources
async def process_ecommerce_event(raw_event):
    # Classify event type and extract business context
    episode_type = classify_business_event(raw_event)
    business_context = extract_business_metrics(raw_event)
    
    # Create structured episode for knowledge graph
    episode = EcommerceEpisode(
        type=episode_type,
        timestamp=raw_event.timestamp,
        context=business_context,
        source_data=raw_event.payload
    )
    
    return episode
```

#### 2. **AI-Powered Entity Extraction**
```python
# Azure OpenAI extracts business entities and relationships
extracted_entities = await openai_client.extract_entities(
    episode.content,
    entity_types=["customer", "product", "category", "transaction", "behavior"],
    business_context=episode.context
)

# Entities include business-specific attributes
# Customer: lifetime_value, segment, preferences
# Product: category, price_point, inventory_status
# Transaction: value, payment_method, fulfillment_type
```

#### 3. **Relationship Intelligence**
```python
# Discover complex business relationships
relationships = await extract_business_relationships(entities)

# Examples:
# Customer --frequently_purchases--> Product Category
# Product --substitutes_for--> Competing Product  
# Customer_Segment --prefers--> Brand
# Season --drives_demand_for--> Product Category
```

#### 4. **Graph Integration & Storage**
```python
# Store in Azure Cosmos DB with business intelligence
await cosmos_client.store_episode(
    episode=episode,
    entities=entities,
    relationships=relationships,
    business_metrics=episode.context
)
