# UV Migration Summary

## Migration Completed: pip â†’ uv

This document summarizes the successful migration from traditional pip/requirements.txt to modern uv dependency management.

### âœ… Completed Tasks

1. **Created `pyproject.toml`**
   - Migrated all dependencies from requirements.txt
   - Added development dependencies (pytest, black, flake8, mypy, pre-commit)
   - Configured optional dependency groups (visualization, jupyter)
   - Set up tool configurations for code quality

2. **Updated Documentation**
   - `README.md`: Updated installation commands from `pip install -r requirements.txt` to `uv sync`
   - `docs/README.md`: Updated setup instructions
   - `docs/TEST_DATA_README.md`: Updated dependency installation
   - `docs/COMPELLING_USE_CASE.md`: Updated installation commands

3. **Updated Scripts**
   - `scripts/setup_environment.ps1`: Changed from pip to uv sync

4. **Git Configuration**
   - Updated `.gitignore` to include uv-specific entries (`.uv/`, `uv.lock`)

5. **Cleanup**
   - Removed old `config/requirements.txt` file
   - Verified no remaining requirements.txt files exist

### ðŸ”§ New Commands

| Old Command | New Command | Purpose |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| `pip install -r requirements.txt` | `uv sync` | Install all dependencies |
| `pip install -e .` | `uv pip install -e .` | Development installation |
| `pip install package` | `uv add package` | Add new dependency |
| `pip install --dev package` | `uv add --dev package` | Add development dependency |

### ðŸ“¦ Dependency Groups

- **Main**: Core runtime dependencies (graphiti-core, azure-cosmos, openai, etc.)
- **Dev**: Development tools (pytest, black, flake8, mypy, pre-commit)
- **Visualization**: Optional viz dependencies (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)
- **Jupyter**: Optional Jupyter support (jupyter, jupyterlab, notebook)

### ðŸš€ Benefits Achieved

1. **Faster Installation**: uv resolves and installs dependencies significantly faster
2. **Better Lock File**: `uv.lock` provides deterministic builds
3. **Modern Standards**: Following Python packaging best practices
4. **Simplified Workflow**: Single `uv sync` command handles everything
5. **Better Dependency Management**: Clear separation of dev vs runtime dependencies

### âœ… Verification

The migration has been tested and verified:
- `uv sync` successfully installs 147 packages
- `uv pip install -e .` works for development installation
- Visualization demo runs successfully with the new setup
- All dependencies properly resolved and compatible


The project is now fully modernized with uv! ðŸŽ‰
